Welcome to the Pizza Restaurant Web Page project! 
This is a simple and visually appealing website for a fictional pizza restaurant, created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Bootstrap is utilized to enhance the overall design and layout of the website. This includes the use of Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities for a clean and modern look.

<h2>Interactive Elements:</h2>
The site includes interactive elements such as a navigation bar, image sliders, and a contact form. These features enhance user engagement and provide a user-friendly experience.
