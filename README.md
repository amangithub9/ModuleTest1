Pizza Restaurant Web Page

Welcome to the Pizza Restaurant Web Page project! 
This is a simple and visually appealing website for a fictional pizza restaurant, created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The goal of this project is to showcase my front-end development skills and design aesthetics.

Features:
Responsive Design:
The web page is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across a variety of devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Bootstrap Integration:
Bootstrap is utilized to enhance the overall design and layout of the website. This includes the use of Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities for a clean and modern look.

Interactive Elements:
The site includes interactive elements such as a navigation bar, image sliders, and a contact form. These features enhance user engagement and provide a user-friendly experience.

Custom Styling:
While Bootstrap provides a solid foundation, custom styling has been applied to tailor the design to the theme of a pizza restaurant. This includes color schemes, typography choices, and custom icons.

Usage:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amangithub9/ModuleTest1.git
